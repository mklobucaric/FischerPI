# Robotic Arm Control GUI with Raspberry Pi 3

This Python code repository contains scripts for a user-friendly Graphical Interface (GUI) that facilitates the command of a Fischertechnik robotic arm via a Raspberry Pi 3. Users can interactively control, reposition and manipulate the robotic arm through this GUI. Additional features include the ability to save, load, and execute sequential programs. Please note, this was a project carried out in 2019 and certain icons have been modified due to the copyright.

## Installation Instructions

For detailed installation instructions and setup diagrams, please refer to the [Installation Manual](Docs/installation_manual.md) and [User Guide](Docs/user_guide.md).

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for manual control over the robotic arm
- Mapping and saving coordinates - allows operators to mark and store key positions required for specific tasks
- Sequential programming and execution
- Instruction saving and reloading
- Homing function - functionality enables the arm to auto-calibrate by returning and resetting to its 'home' or default position
- Gripper manipulation - versatile control over the gripper enabling variety of opening and closing actions.
